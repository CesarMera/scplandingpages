            <p class="title">SCP-096 "El Timido"</p>
            <p class="description">
                It is a humanoid creature that measures approximately 2.38 meters
                Tall. The subject shows very little muscle mass,
                Preliminary body mass analysis suggests malnutrition
                mild.
                His arms are extremely disproportionate to the
                rest of the subject's body, with a length of approximately 1.5
                meters each.
                The skin is practically devoid of pigmentation and there is no evidence of
                that has body hair.

            <p class="title">SCP-049 "Dr. Muerte"</p>
            <p class="description">
                It is a humanoid entity about 1.9 meters tall,
                who has the appearance of a medieval plague doctor.
                While SCP-049 appears to be wearing the thick robes and mask
                ceramics typical of that profession, their clothes seem to have
                grown from SCP-049's body over time1, and
                It is almost indiscernible from the shape that may lie beneath them.
                X-rays indicate that, despite this,
                SCP-049 has a humanoid skeletal structure under its cloak
                abroad.

            <p class="title">SCP-999 " El monstruo de las cosquillas</p>
            <p class="description">
                It appears to be a large amorphous, gelatinous mass of mud.
                translucent orange, weighing about 54 kg (120 lbs),
                with a consistency similar to that of butter
                peanut.
                The size and shape of the subject is easily malleable and
                can change shape at will,
                although when resting, SCP-999 turns into a dome
                rounded and oblong approximately 2 meters wide and
                1 meter high.

            <p class="title">SCP-343 "Dios"</p>
            <p class="description">
                He is a male, of indeterminate race, humanoid in appearance with
                apparent omnipotence. SCP-343 was discovered walking around
                streets of Prague and stopped by a member of staff who saw
                how he disappeared to reappear on a roof. SCP-343 remains
                detained of his own free will, since his containment is impossible.

            " The galaxy is dark, and empty, and cold. It inevitably turns 
            towards death. You will die too, one day. Maybe they live longer 
            than us. We hope so. But one day they too must disappear.

            Until then, you must illuminate the darkness. 
            They must make the night less empty. 
            We are small, and the universe is vast, but a universe with 
            voices saying “Here I am” is much larger than a silent universe. 
            A voice is small, but the difference between zero and one is as 
            big as one and infinity.
            And when your time is ending, please send this message, 
            so that the next voice can speak against the darkness. "
